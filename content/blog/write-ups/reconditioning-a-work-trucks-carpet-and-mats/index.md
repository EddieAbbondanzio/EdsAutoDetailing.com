Detailing work trucks can be a difficult, yet rewarding task. The interiors are often very dirty, and need some serious attention. This work truck is a newer GMC 2500 quad cab pickup with a carpet and cloth interior. It has a little over 100k miles on the odometer and was used for construction. 

Overall the truck is in fairly decent shape and the interior is the only place that needs major work. The truck received a full detail that was upgraded to include our interior deep clean service. Most of the time spent on the interior went into the carpet, and is what we'll be focusing on.

# Assessing The Situation

The driver footwell is the worst area with large piles of dirt below the gas pedal, and by the footrest. Closer towards the front of the driver seat a large section of the carpet has dried mud that has solidified into a rock-hard layer completely hiding the carpet.

The passenger footwell is in better shape with nearly no mud. Instead, there is an abundance of dirt and sand that has piled up on the floor mat and carpet below it.

The rear carpet of the cab was lightly covered with small debris and dirt. None of the dirt had penetrated deep into the carpet as it appears few passengers rode in the rear of the vehicle.

# Cleaning The Floor Mats

Thankfully the truck has rubber floor mats that managed to capture a large portion of the dirt and dust. Rubber floor mats are easier to restore than carpet mats, and are highly recommended for any vehicle that endures Maine's harsh winters. 

The driver front floor mat has so much dust on it that it's almost hard to tell the floor mat used to be black.

It's going to take a few steps to restore these floor mats. To begin, we'll start off by hosing them down with water to break any loose dirt free. From there we'll spray them with a strong degreaser and allow them to soak for 10 - 15 minutes giving the degreaser time to work it's magic. Depending on condition we may repeat this step twice.

{{< figure src="images/post/3b.jpg" alt="Driver and passenger rear floor mats soaking in degreaser." >}}

After they've soaked for a bit we bring out the brushes. A small brush that's about twice as large as a toothbrush is used to scrub the nooks and crannies of the floor mats. It's a time consuming task to slowly clean each mat but it's needed to ensure no dirt is left behind. 

Once the hard to reach spots of all 4 mats have been scrubbed, a larger brush is brought out to clean the open areas. When a floor mat has a texture such as the diamond plate design on these it's best to scrub in multiple directions.

With a final rinse the floor mats are set aside to dry. We also check the back sides to ensure we haven't missed anything that could dirty up the carpet once reinstalled. The mats will take awhile to air dry, but once dried up, they'll look good as new.

# Restoring The Carpet

Returning back to the carpet, there's plenty of work to be done. In the driver's footwell a large amount of mud found its way under the floor mat. Most of it has dried up into a thick solid layer but some of it was still damp to the touch. The footrest on the left had so much dirt surrounding it that it nearly filled up the crevice between the footrest and plastic trim.

The passenger footwell is in slightly better shape with less mud. There seems to be more dust on this side but it's dry and should be manageable with the vacuum. Where the carpet meets the door sill will need to be blasted with compressed air to get anything trapped underneath out.

The rear carpet is in much better shape. There's a lot of dirt and debris but it's mostly on top of the carpet and not very deep. There is some slight discoloration from all the dirt that gives away the outline of where the mats used to sit.

## Removing Loose Debris And Trapped Dirt

To start off we'll vacuum up any loose dirt and debris. After doing a thorough pass we use a special air tool called a Tornador that blasts pulses of compressed air into the carpet to loosen up dirt trapped deep in the carpet. This step is repeated as many times as needed until all the dirt is removed. 

A large section of the mud in the driver's footwell was so thick that neither the vacuum nor tornador would touch it. The only thing that will be able to remove it is the carpet extractor, and it'll require several passes.

The tornador was able to blast out most of the dust on the passenger side footwell.

The rear carpet is already looking better. It's harder to distinguish the outline of where the floor mats sat. Even most of the discoloration has been removed as well.

## Extracting The Carpet

With the carpet as clean as possible it's ready to be extracted. The carpet extractor works by spraying in scalding hot (210F) water then immediately extracting the water out using two powerful suction pumps. The hot water makes quick work of breaking down any dirt, mud, salt, or stains which can then be pulled out as the water is sucked out.

Working the extractor takes times to carefully cover the entire carpet. Most of the carpet will only require a single pass, but spots that need more attention can take several passes before they clean up.

# Finishing Up

Once the carpet has been fully dried it's given one last final vacuum. The final pass with the vacuum ensures we've gotten every last bit of dirt or debris. All nooks and crannies are examined using a flash light to ensure nothing was missed. Then the floor mats are reinstalled. 

It's hard to tell the carpet used to be covered in mud or dirt. Almost all stains were removed, and nearly no discoloration remains.

The rear carpet is almost like new again.

# Conclusion

Work trucks have to endure a lot more than regular vehicles. They may require extra time to bring them back to life, but more often than not the results speak for themselves. 

Total time for this interior was 6.5 hours not including dry time. About 3.5 hours went directly into the carpet and floor mats. The rest of the time was spent on cleaning up the vinyl, seats, windows, and door jams.
