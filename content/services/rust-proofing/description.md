# Description

Don't let rust eat up your vehicle. Maine's winters are cold and long and the road salt we use to de-ice our roads can cause large amounts of rust to build up in just one winter. 

Our rust proofing service gives your vehicle a protective layer to shield it from the salt. We'll apply fluid film to the underside of your vehicle including all nooks and crannies. Factory rubber grommets are removed to get access to the insides panels such as the rocker panels, and frames. 

Fluid film can last up to two winters depending on how much the vehicle is driven.
