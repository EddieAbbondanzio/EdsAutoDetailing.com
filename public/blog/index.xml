      <description>Detailing work trucks can be a difficult, yet rewarding task. The interiors are often very dirty, and need some serious attention. This work truck is a newer GMC 2500 quad cab pickup with a carpet and cloth interior. It has a little over 100k miles on the odometer and was used for construction.
Overall the truck is in fairly decent shape and the interior is the only place that needs major work.</description>
