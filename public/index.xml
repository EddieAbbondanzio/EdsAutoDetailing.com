      <description>Detailing work trucks can be a difficult, yet rewarding task. The interiors are often very dirty, and need some serious attention. This work truck is a newer GMC 2500 quad cab pickup with a carpet and cloth interior. It has a little over 100k miles on the odometer and was used for construction.
Overall the truck is in fairly decent shape and the interior is the only place that needs major work.</description>

      <description>How do you quote details? We quote based off vehicle size, and condition. Since it can be difficult to assess the condition of the vehicle over the phone we&#39;ll give you a price range of what the cost could be. Upon seeing the vehicle we can give an absolute amount and promise not to raise the price after completing the job. All quotes are valid for 30 days.
Do you accept credit cards?</description>
